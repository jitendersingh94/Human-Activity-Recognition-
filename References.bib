abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the latest generation of smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively---just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily/weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.},

    abstract = { Activity recognition systems are a large field of research and development, currently with a focus on advanced machine learning algorithms, innovations in the field of hardware architecture, and on decreasing the costs of monitoring while increasing safety. This article concentrates on the applications of activity recognition systems and surveys their state of the art. We categorize such applications into active and assisted living systems for smart homes, healthcare monitoring applications, monitoring and surveillance systems for indoor and outdoor activities, and tele-immersion applications. Within these categories, the applications are classified according to the methodology used for recognizing human behavior, namely, based on visual, non-visual, and multimodal sensor technology. We provide an overview of these applications and discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach. Additionally, we illustrate public data sets that are designed for the evaluation of such recognition systems. The article concludes with a comparison of the existing methodologies which, when applied to real-world scenarios, allow to formulate research questions for future approaches. }

abstract = {The healthcare benefits associated with regular physical activity monitoring and recognition has been considered in several research studies. Solid evidence shows that regular monitoring and recognition of physical activity can potentially assist to manage and reduce the risk of many diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular and diabetes. A few studies have been carried out in order to develop effective human activity recognition system using smartphone. However, understanding the role of each sensor embedded in the smartphone for activity recognition is essential and need to be investigated. Due to the recent outstanding performance of artificial neural networks in human activity recognition, this work aims to investigate the role of gyroscope and accelerometer sensors and its combination for automatic human activity detection, analysis and recognition using artificial neural networks. The experimental result on the publicly available dataset indicates that each of the sensors can be used for human activity recognition separately. However, accelerometer sensor data performed better than gyroscope sensor data with classification accuracy of 92%. Combining accelerometer and gyroscope performed better than when used individually with an accuracy of 95%.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach.Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Human activity recognition (HAR) tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features obtained by heuristic processes. Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparametersâ€™ influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.},
